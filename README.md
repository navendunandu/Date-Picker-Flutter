# ðŸ“Œ **Flutter Date, Month, and Year Picker**

This Flutter project provides three separate pickers:

- **ðŸ“† Date Picker** â€“ Allows users to select a full date (day, month, year).
- **ðŸ“… Month Picker** â€“ Enables selection of only the month.
- **ðŸ“† Year Picker (18+ Restriction)** â€“ Users can only select a birth year if they are at least 18 years old.

Each picker is **embedded directly on the screen**, ensuring smooth user interaction without popups.

## **ðŸ”§ How It Works**

1. **Navigation:**

   - The app starts with a **home screen**, where users can choose between the **Date Picker, Month Picker, and Year Picker**.
   - Clicking on a button navigates to the corresponding picker screen.

2. **ðŸ“† Date Picker:**

   - Uses `flutter_holo_date_picker` to allow users to select a full date (day, month, year).
   - The selected date is displayed in real time.

3. **ðŸ“… Month Picker:**

   - Displays a scrollable list of months using `ListWheelScrollView`.
   - Users can smoothly scroll and pick a month, which updates dynamically.

4. **ðŸ“† Year Picker (18+ Restriction):**

   - Restricts year selection based on age (users must be **at least 18 years old**).
   - The available range is dynamically calculated (`Current Year - 18` to `Current Year - 100`).
   - Uses `ListWheelScrollView` for a smooth scrolling experience.
